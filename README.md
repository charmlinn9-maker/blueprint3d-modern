# Blueprint3D

A modernized 3D interior design application built on Three.js that allows users to create floor plans and design interior spaces.

This project is a comprehensive modernization of [furnishup/blueprint3d](https://github.com/furnishup/blueprint3d), originally created 9 years ago.

## Features

- **2D Floor Planning**: Create and edit floor plans with walls, doors, and windows
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time 3D rendering of interior spaces
- **Item Placement**: Add and arrange furniture and decorative items
- **Interactive Design**: Modify layouts and items in both 2D and 3D views
